# MNIST-ImageProcessing
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on image processing and analysis of image data from the MNIST dataset. The project is aimed to implement handwritten digit recognition using a RandomForestClassifier.

## Repository Structure
- "Image Processing- MNIST_TASK.ipynb": Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation.
- "README.md": Project documentation.

I used a "Keras" library to access the dataset (e.g. from keras.datasets import mnist). If you want to download the dataset manually, you can do so through their official website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## Usage
- Open "Image Processing- MNIST_TASK.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.
